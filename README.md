# MITxPRO DLMN ESP M3 Assignment

## Author
Wencio Martinez

## Description
This assignment is part of the MITxPRO Data Learning and Machine Networks (DLMN) ESP Module 3. The focus of this assignment is on building a classifier for the MNIST dataset using PyTorch.

## Overview
In this assignment, we will classify the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database). The dataset contains tens of thousands of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9 and is commonly used to train machine learning algorithms. The provided notebook includes basic code to load the data, and you are required to build a deep neural network trained on this dataset. You are encouraged to reuse code from previous notebooks.

### Steps Included:
1. **Introduction**: Brief description of the MNIST dataset and the goal of the assignment.
2. **Data Loading**: Using PyTorch's built-in functions to load the MNIST dataset.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to preprocess the data for training.
4. **Model Training**: Building and training a neural network model using PyTorch.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the trained model.
6. **Conclusions**: Summarizing the results and potential next steps.

# Activity for Module 3: Classification of the MNIST Dataset

Now that we have learned how to use everything that PyTorch offers, we are going to classify a specific dataset. Specifically, we will build a classifier for the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. This dataset contains tens of thousands of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9 and is often used to train machine learning algorithms. In this activity, we will provide basic code to load the data, and you should build a deep neural network trained on this dataset. You are encouraged to reuse the code you have written or seen in previous notebooks.

First, we will load the MNIST dataset. PyTorch offers a series of built-in functions to load frequently used image datasets, including MNIST.

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install the necessary packages by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook /mnt/data/MITxPRO_DLMN_ESP_M3_Assignment_ASC_wencio_martinez.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code and see the results.
